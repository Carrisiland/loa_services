\section{Project idea}
The main idea behind the project is a video-clip sharing service based on
existing video platforms. Our website will work a little bit like imgur, but for
videos: you will be able to share moments of a video (just by providing
timestamps) both anonymously or with an imgur-like account. You will be able to
vote and comment on existing post, or to join multiple clips in an album.
